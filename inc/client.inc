 * be run multiple times as separate tasks for each web site that wants a chat program, with a single
 * parameter giving the data directory for that instance should reside.  It should be executable by the 
 * user running php (with the web server or fastcgi)
 * 
 * DATA_DIR defines for a particular instance where that data directory for that instance and should be re-configured
 * for each web site that uses it.  It should be writeable by the php.  It should also be outside of web space so it cannot
 * be seen directly by the user
